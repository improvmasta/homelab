1.  Create VM, set to boot from ubuntu server ISO image
2.  Static IP is recommended - I set a static lease on my router for the MAC address of the new VM
3.  Secure Boot must be OFF
4.  Install Ubuntu Server.  Choose the option Install SSH during ubuntu setup
5.  SSH into server and execute these commands:
	$ wget https://github.com/improvmasta/homelab/raw/refs/heads/main/setup.sh
	$ sudo chmod +x setup.sh
	$ ./setup.sh
